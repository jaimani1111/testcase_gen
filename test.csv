1. Log in to the insurance portal as a commercial user.
2. Navigate to the ""Get a Quote"" page and select ""Auto"" as the insurance type.
3. Select ""Asia Pacific"" as the region.
4. Choose ""Commercial"" as the line of business.
5. Enter the following fleet details:
	* Fleet size: 10 vehicles
	* Vehicle types:
		+ 3x amphibious vehicles (e.g., amphibious trucks)
		+ 2x electric buses
		+ 2x refrigerated trucks
		+ 1x crane-mounted truck
		+ 1x towing truck with a carrying capacity of 5 tons
		+ 1x vintage car (1970s model) used for promotional events
6. Enter the following details for each vehicle:
	* Year of manufacture
	* Make and model
	* Vehicle identification number (VIN)
	* Current mileage
	* Driver information (name, age, driving experience, and license number)
7. Enter the business information:
	* Business name
	* Business address
	* Industry type (e.g., logistics, construction, tourism)
8. Select the desired coverage options:
	* Liability coverage: $1 million
	* Collision coverage: $50,000
	* Comprehensive coverage: $20,000
	* Personal accident coverage: $500,000
9. Click ""Get Quote"" to generate the insurance quote.

**Expected Results:**

1. The system should display a quote that includes the total premium amount, coverage details, and any applicable discounts or surcharges.
2. The quote should accurately reflect the unusual vehicle types and their corresponding coverage requirements.
3. The system should not throw any errors or exceptions due to the unusual vehicle types or large fleet size.

**Edge Cases and Variations:**

* Test with an even larger fleet size (e.g., 50 vehicles) to ensure the system can handle bulk inputs.
* Try entering invalid or missing information for one or more vehicles (e.g., invalid VIN, missing driver information) to test error handling.
* Select an extremely high coverage limit (e.g., $10 million) to test the system's upper bounds.
* Test with a mix of old and new vehicles (e.g., 1960s model and 2022 model) to ensure the system can handle a wide range of vehicle ages.

This test case covers unusual vehicle types, a large fleet size, and a mix of high-value and special-use vehicles, making it a unique and challenging test for the system.","Step 1: Navigate to the module.
